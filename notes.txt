a. Why did you design the code this way?
Ans: This is the best possible code i could write in given time.I made this assignment only on front end.


b. What data structures/APIs did you use and why?
Ans: I am using google maps javascript api for maps , in task 1 - map is generated by getting user input(lat and lon)
and passing required options to map object.

task 2 - It takes city name as user input and gets latitude and longitude from ajax call to reverse geolocation api ,
then passing those values to generate a map.
